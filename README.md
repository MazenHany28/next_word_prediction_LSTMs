# next_word_prediction_LSTMs
In this project, we focus on developing a text prediction model using "Les Mis√©rables" by Victor Hugo, a classic novel known for its rich language.
Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, we aim to capture the patterns of language and context present in the text. The LSTMs ability to handle sequences of data makes it particularly suitable for this task.
The implementation involves several key steps: data preprocessing to clean and tokenize the text, sequence generation to create training data, model building and training, and finally, model evaluation and prediction.
